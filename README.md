# Minesweeper

A java swing implementation of minesweeper which I made 4 years ago. My first ever project :D

I asked to review it at https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/215081/minesweeper-game-in-java-using-swing-gui#
(Not great code, but the refactored one in the code-review link is great)

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/porridgewithraisins/minesweeper
cd minesweeper
java --enable-preview -cp bin App
```
(Requires that JDK is installed)
